Student Performance Prediction
Overview
This project aims to analyze the factors influencing student academic performance using a provided dataset. We implement linear regression from scratch using numpy and pandas, compare the results with a library implementation, and analyze the performance of both models.

Project Structure
Code: Python code for data analysis, model implementation, training, and evaluation.
Report: A comprehensive report detailing the analysis and results.
Dataset: The Student Performance Dataset used for the analysis.
Files
dataset/student_performance.csv: The dataset file.
code/linear_regression_from_scratch.py: Python script implementing linear regression from scratch.
code/linear_regression_with_library.py: Python script using a regression library.
report/report.pdf: The project report with analysis and results.
colab_notebooks/from_scratch.ipynb: Google Colab notebook for linear regression from scratch.
colab_notebooks/with_library.ipynb: Google Colab notebook for regression using library.
Steps to Run the Code
1. Linear Regression from Scratch
Identify the dependent and independent variables:

Dependent Variable: Student Performance
Independent Variables: Hours of study, Previous score, Extracurricular Activities, Duration of Sleep, Sample Question Papers Practiced
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Load the dataset
Data preprocessing
Visualize the data with meaningful plots
Data Splitting:

Split the dataset into train (80%) and test (20%) sets.
Linear Regression Implementation:

Implement linear regression from scratch using numpy and pandas.
Train the model with the training data.
Training and Evaluation:

Plot the loss vs epoch curve.
Predict student performance for given input data.
Evaluate model performance using MSE and R2 Score.
Run the script code/linear_regression_from_scratch.py or open colab_notebooks/from_scratch.ipynb in Google Colab.

2. Linear Regression with Library
Use of Library:

Implement regression using a Python library (e.g., scikit-learn).
Training and Evaluation:

Train the model with the training data.
Evaluate model performance using the same metrics.
Run the script code/linear_regression_with_library.py or open colab_notebooks/with_library.ipynb in Google Colab.

Comparison and Improvement
The report includes a detailed comparison of the results from both models. Based on the analysis, potential improvements to the model's performance are discussed.

Results
The model from scratch was implemented successfully and evaluated using MSE and R2 Score.
The library-based model provided a baseline for comparison.
Insights and possible improvements are documented in the report.
