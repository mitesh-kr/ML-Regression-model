# Student Performance Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts student performance based on various attributes using Linear Regression. The model is implemented from scratch using NumPy and pandas, and results are compared with a library-based regression model.

## Dataset  
The dataset contains various student attributes that influence academic performance.  ðŸ“¥ **Download here:** [Student Performance Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ik1JdRC9eWljtclz_WkYmDEJA7cvcxJY/view)

# Steps Covered
## 1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing

Identified dependent and independent variables
Handled missing values and performed feature encoding
Visualized data with meaningful plots
## 2. Train-Test Split

Splitting data into 80% training and 20% testing
## 3. Linear Regression (from scratch)

Implemented using NumPy and pandas
Used Gradient Descent for optimization
Plotted Loss vs. Epoch curve
## 4. Prediction

Predicted student performance for a given input
## 5. Model Evaluation

Evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score
